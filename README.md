**Brief idea of Project**: 

The objective of our project is to provide users with a cheap, printer-sized laboratory to experiment with Aeroponics. 
Aeroponics is a technique of growing plants using nutrient-infused mist instead of liquid water. 
Aeroponics is similar to hydroponics, but has the advantage that it requires even less water than it. 
We know that plant growth is affected by several factors: seed variety, amount of water, brightness, humidity, and temperature. 
Our project allows users to track 3 features (brightness, humidity, temperature), and understand how they affect plant growth. 
By trying out various combinations of these factors, we want users to be able to find combinations which will lead to optimum plant height or fruit yield.

**Applications of Project**:
1. For carrying out sustainable agriculture, in regions where water is scarce
2. For generating experimental data on the environmental conditions which optimize plant growth
